# Google Chat Bot
A collection of python scripts for posting news in google chatrooms.
The main idea of the project was to keep the team united and informed when working from home. 
There is important information in teams' daily tasks that needs to be shared with everybody like:
- team availability (who is out of office, who is working from home, who is working from office)
- calendar events (new product releases, phone shifts etc)
